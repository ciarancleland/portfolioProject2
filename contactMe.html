            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Ciaran Cleland. I am a 29 Year Old who has recently decided to take a career path change! But you can learn more about that in my History of Ciaran Section!</p>
            <p>Web Developement was always something I had considered, but due to my career decisions in life, did not seem obtainable. That is until I learned about Codecademy!</p>
            <p>I am an avid fan of travelling. But then again, who isn't! To date I have travelled within 14 countries and 19 American States, and am not done yet!</p>
            <p>In my spare time; I enjoy eating lots of different kinds of food, some exercising, reading and consuming more Tv/Film than a person probaby should! Since starting my codecademy, I have also found a new hobbie in trying to learn and test myself with new methods and coding skills to improve my current knowledge base. </p>

            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>I had been living in America for the last 8 years. Before that though I grew up in Castlewellan, Co Down, Ireland. Look it's <a href ='https://www.google.com/search?q=castlewellan&rlz=1CAKDZI_enUS1075&oq=castlewellan&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYjwIyBwgAEAAYjwIyDQgBEC4YgwEYsQMYgAQyBggCEEUYQDIICAMQRRgnGDsyBggEEEUYOzIGCAUQRRg8MgYIBhBFGDwyBggHEEUYPNIBCDIzNzdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8' target="_blank" title="Castlewellan">right here!</a></p>
            <p>Growing up I played different sports, but my main focus was on Karate, where I achieved numerous trophies and medals, and was fortunate enough to earn my 1st Dan Black Belt at the age of 17.</p>
            <p>In my early years I was a student of St Malachys Primary School, before moving to St Louis Grammar School for my secondary levelk educations. A big thanks to those teachers who helped me throughout.</p>
            <p>I studied at St Marys University Belfast to become a Secondary School Teacher, but that idea was short lived! The teaching world was just not for me. It was shortly after this at the age of 21 I moved to America</p>
            <p>While living in America I had the privledge of moving to different states throughout my time. Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Each showing me some interesting places and people.</p>
            <p>I found myself in the world of Country Clubs working within the Hospitality Sector, and worked my way up to a Directorship level by the time leaving the industry. The 1 area I truely fell in love with throughout this was Bars; their creation, development and management. Along with the Wine. Waow I had my eyes opened!</p>
